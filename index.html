	Okay, so i have a <b>beef</b> with how aliens are portrayed on the media and in literature. There, i said it! The way aliens are portrayed is totally unrealistic usually, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)" target="_blank">bar some exceptions</a>.<br>When someone says "aliens" what is the first thing that comes to mind?</p>
	<br>
	<div class="pinakaki">
	<h3 style="margin:4px;">The aliens:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Are <strong>humanoid or animal</strong> inspired or an amalgamation</li>
<li>Have better technology</li>
<li>Usually come to conquer earth
	<br><i>&lt;sarcasm>because what other reason can they possibly have?!) &lt;/sarcasm> </i> </li>
<li><strong><em>Have human scale</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Some pictures to illustrate my point:</h3>

	<em>And so many others -like from Warhammer 40k, or Starcraft, or or or...</em> <br>
	Why is the alien depiciton so..."<i>traditional</i>" in sci-fi? Might as well make it only humans, <small>we treat each other worse that what we'd treat aliens anyway..</small>.

	<h2 id="time-concept">Concept of time</h2>
<p>
	What people fail to realise is the vastness of the universe and how <strong>DIFFERENT</strong> conditions may apply to different parts of it. <br>
		For example: take our scope, we have a certain lifespan, the microbes in our body have different. Do they form communities? talk to each other? Maybe, maybe not, this is our imagination that we talk about, but  Are they experiencing time the same way? I'd wager not. <br>
			Probably what seems like a couple minutes to us, it probably is already half a lifetime for a smaller lifeform. Following on this, if we encounter a larger lifeform their lifespan will be quite larger than ours. This whole concept of time experiencing has some other rammifications as well. How one communicates with the other? We make a sentence and we know how long it takes to communicate a certain meaning. What happens to a smaller lifeform? probably their sentence takes a fraction of that and a larger lifeform would need <a href="https://youtu.be/8vjDjCv-ekM?t=98" target="_blank">(as is <em>very</em> aptly shown in the Lord of the Rings)</a> days or weeks to just to say hi! In a nutshell, <strong>every lifeform experiences time quite differently</strong>, which if nothing else has consequenses with communication -especially cross-species communication.

			<h2 id="material-concept">Material concept</h2>
		<p>
		The concept of time is one thing. The next one is what are their <strong>fundamental building blocks</strong>? It could be carbon, since it's highly versatile -we are made out of carbon-, but it could also be some other element that is their fundamental block. It could be silicon, iron, or any other block. Is a sense the machinery we operate could be a lifeform, they need electricity to operate much like we need oxygen and water. Why a silicon based alien would be different from that? Oxygen and water could be toxic to them, or hazardous. Or if we don't go to the radical differences, even if they need oxygen or water, what is to say they consume the same amount? maybe they need less than 21% or maybe they need more.

	<h2 id="surrender">"Defeat..."</h2>
<p>
	Probably all these choices are made so aliens look humanlike mostly, or <em>slightly</em> different, so we, as human viewers can have some empathy towards those characters. Imagine a tree, probably you don't think much, but you do with a cat or a dog. A tree though is a living being, built from the same material as us, but "slightly" different on the cosmic scale, yet we think of trees as borderline alien in our lives.
